   1. Save the script to a file called yt-to-clip.sh.
   2. Give it execute permissions:

chmod +x yt-to-clip.sh
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:
```bash
./yt-to-clip.sh
```
Then:

1.	Paste the YouTube URL when prompted.
2.	Enter the start and end times in HH:MM:SS format.
3.	Your trimmed clip will be saved as output.mp4!


## 📸 Example

```bash
$ ./yt-to-clip.sh
Enter the YouTube video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Downloading video...
Enter start time (HH:MM:SS): 00:01:00
Enter end time (HH:MM:SS): 00:01:15

## ⚡ How It Works

## ⚠️ Notes
